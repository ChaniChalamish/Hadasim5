**Why Use Parquet in Python?**
Parquet has become a go-to format for handling large datasets, especially in the data engineering and analytics world. Hereâ€™s why you might choose Parquet over other formats (like CSV or JSON) when working in Python:

- **Efficient Data Storage:** Parquet's columnar format reduces file sizes and speeds up queries, making it ideal for large datasets.
- **Interoperability:** Parquet works seamlessly with distributed data processing tools like Apache Spark, Dremio, and Hadoop, as well as cloud storage services like AWS S3.
- **Schema Enforcement:** Parquet supports structured data and schema enforcement, ensuring data consistency.
- **Compatibility:** Python libraries like PyArrow and FastParquet make it easy to integrate Parquet with popular Python data science tools like Pandas.
